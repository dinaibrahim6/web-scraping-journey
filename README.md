# web-scraping-journey


Welcome to my **Web Scraping Journey** — a collection of small projects built to document my learning process as I explore web scraping.


## Tools & Libraries
- `requests` — for making HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup4` — for parsing HTML
- `openpyxl` — for saving scraped data in Excel
- `pandas` — for data cleaning and analysis
I would add another tools while i go along with the journey.
