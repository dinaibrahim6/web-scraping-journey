# web-scraping-journey


Welcome to my **Web Scraping Journey** — a collection of small projects built to document my learning process as I explore web scraping.


## Tools & Libraries
- `requests` — for making HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup4` — for parsing HTML
- `openpyxl` — for saving scraped data in Excel
- `pandas` — for data cleaning and analysis
I would add another tools while i go along with the journey.

#  ScrapQuotes_to_Excel (ScrapQuotes_to_Excel/) 

### Project Description
This project is part of my **Web Scraping Journey** .

In this first project, I built a Python script that:
- Scrapes **quotes tagged with “love”** from [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/tag/love/)
- Extracts each **quote, author, and tags**
- Saves the results neatly in an **Excel file** using `openpyxl`
